# How to contribute

Howdy! Help is always appreciated :)


## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to JosephMart/PersonalSite](https://github.com/josephmart/PersonalSite/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow my coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * I indent using 4 spaces (soft tabs)
  * I ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.

Thanks,
Joseph Martinsen
