# Joseph Martinsen's site

## Running the site locally

Ensure you have `yarn`, `ruby`, and `ruby-devel` installed

```bash
yarn global add gulp       # Install gulp globally
yarn install               # Install npm packages
gem install jekyll bundler # Install `jekyll` and `bundle`
bundle install             # Install ruby gems
```
If you want to run live reloading server: `gulp dev`

If you want to build static site: `gulp`
